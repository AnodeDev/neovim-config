# MY NEOVIM CONFIG

## Introduction

This is my personal, minimalist config for Neovim. It does not have any LSP's or linters, or any annoying features like NERDTree. It uses the Catppuccin color scheme, which is the **BEST** color scheme, and it has some QoF features such as a markdown viewer. But other than that it's just Neovim, with a couple custom keybindings for the Colemak-dh keyboard layout.

## Plugins

- Catppuccin (Specifically `frappe` but this can easily be changed in the `catppuccin.lua` file)
- Lualine (With the `evil` theme modified to use `catppuccin frappe` colors, can also easily be changed) 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo into `~/.config` and name the folder `nvim`
2. Open Neovim and let Lazy do it's thing
